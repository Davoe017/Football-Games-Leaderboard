# Football-Games-Leaderboard
This is a python code that uses the Linear Congruential method to randomly generate scores for 8 teams with 5 matchups and no repetition amongst teams. A win indicate 3 points and a draw 1 point
Football Games:
We have A-H teams, generate random scores for the matchups for 5 weeks, but the
highest possible goals for each of these teams is 8 . Note that some teams have
strengths, e.g not more than 4 goals or more than 8 goals. Track the points for the 5
weeks using the scoring metric:
The way the matchups are done should be randomly generated with no repetition. Use the
linear congruential method.
